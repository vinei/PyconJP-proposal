## Proposal title
__*Start a Python Community and Prepare for PyCon Cambodia*__

## Session type
__*20 Minutes talk*__

## Track
__*Python in education*__

## Language
__*English*__

## Abstract
In recent years, Cambodia has rapidly increased in computer science. There are so many tech startups and the demand for tech skills is at a high peak. Cambodia's education both in public and private schools started to adopt the STEM, yet there is still a lack of support from the community.
So we'd love to start a Python community in Cambodia to gather local developer to support young generation.

## Description
Because I strongly beleive that in the very short future ahead, tech skills would be mandantory for every individual to work and live in the modern tech society. That is the main reason that urge us to start running, support and contribute to the society by encouraging, motivating and support the young learner. I've attended and participated in many events and program before, also I've volunteer in few tutoring program specific on tech and computer science. I see there are a lot of struggle and requires help from those student and younger to guide them.
Creating the Python community is not only our goal, also in the future, we're planning to prepare and organize the PyCon in Cambodia.

## Things that not cover in this session
- Explain in detail about STEM program
- Tech startup market cap in Cambodia
- Rise and fall of some tech startup
- Talk in detail of existing tech related community in Cambodia

## Why did I choose this topic?
I want to see my country involved and grow in technology starting from lower education. There are many ways to support the community and young generation, but I can start doing contributions to the community to keep encouraging the youngster to pursue tech skills even if they're interested in becoming another profession, I want them to consider computer science as their secondary knowledge foundation.
