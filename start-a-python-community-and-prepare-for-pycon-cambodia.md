## Abstract
In the last fews years, in Cambodia has rapidly increased in computer science and STEM education enrollments. There are so many tech startup in different sector start to appear which the demand of tech skills is at high peak. Cambodia education both in public and private school started to adopted the STEM concept (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), yet there is still lack of supports from the community to help boost this society impact.
So we'd love to start a Python community in Cambodia to gater the local experienced developer in Python to unite in order to encourge, motivate and support the young generation.
Also, in the future we're planning to prepare and organize the PyCon in Cambodia.

## Description

Because I strongly beleive that in the very short future ahead, tech skills would be mandantory for every individual to work and live in the modern tech society.

## Things that not cover in this session
- Explain in detail about STEM program
- Tech startup market cap in Cambodia
- Rise and fall of some tech startup
- Talk in detail of existing tech related community in Cambodia

## Why did I choose this topic?
I want to see my country to involve and grow in technology starting from lower education. There are many ways to support the community and young generation, but for me personally I can start doing the contribution through the community to keep encourage youngster to persue in tech skills even they're interest in becoming another profession, I want them to consider computer science as their secondary knowledge foundation.
