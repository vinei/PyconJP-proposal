## Abstract
In recent years, people's daily lifestyles have rapidly changed, how they live and do their work. There are many works each individual has to be responsible for, yet there is not enough time for them. There are many new technologies created to help people automate their work, like the IoT concept. In this session, I'll talk about how we can run Python script directly on iPhone/iPad for automation.
 
## Description
Python is one of the powerful languages which is also well-known for its automation of things and stuff. Developers have been using Python for creating various types of applications in many different use-cases. 
But this topic will cover specifically automation with a python script on iPhone/iPad using [**Pythonista**](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/index.html) to accomplish the tasks that would not require people to directly interact with but can be done via Python programming and public API provider.
I've been exploring and using Pythonista to write and execute Python scripts to help me with some daily tasks and my side hustle business. One example of my use-case is for creating the subscription user account because creating a user requires an administrator to login into the dashboard, fill out the user info, add the user into the correct cohort, then send the account credential to the user via Facebook page manager, and then send the payment link. To complete this operation before it would take me approximately 10 minutes, most importantly I also need to focus on my work tasks too, but I can automate all of these steps with the Python script and cloud function, all I need to do is just click on the shortcut icon on iPhone/iPad or calling the Siri. 
This is just one example and of course, I want to use this to motivate people to start exploring and implementing this to help them with their tasks.

## Why did I choose this topic?
Because automation is an interesting topic and now with the capability to do it from their iPhone/iPad, this will be so much helpful and fun at the same time. I think this will help to boost and motivate the young learner to explore more on Python by starting right from their iPhone/iPad. Also, the ultimate goal is that I and the team, we'd like to start a Python community in Cambodia and host PyCon Cambodia next year or next next year!

## What the audience will learn and know-how from this topic
- Know how to write and run Python programs on their iPhone/iPad.
- Accessing useful data with Pythonista IOS-specific modules.
- Run their program with iPhone/iPad app icon, extension, and Siri.
- Having fun with automation from their mobile phone.
- They will come up with some great ideas to automate their workflows.

## Prior knowledge the audience should have
- Basic Python syntax

## Audience experiment
Beginner student is good to go, it's all about interesting and fun.
