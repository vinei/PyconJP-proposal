## Abstract
In the last decade, there is so much changes in people dialy lifestyle, how people live, communicate and doing their works and tasks. There are so many works each individual have to responsilbe for, yet there is not enough time for them to do so. However there are many new techologies and tools created for the purpose to help people automate their works, like IOT concept. 
However there are various of ways to automate stuffs, but in this session I'll be talking about how we can write a python script and execute it directly on Iphone/Ipad with the application called [**Pythonista**](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/index.html) to automate things that can be done by python programming, also we can execute python script on Iphone/Ipad to invoke the cloud function which would extend the capability to wide range of usecases. Another interesting thing is that with Pythonista on Iphone/Ipad, we can execute our script or shortcut with the voice command to Siri.
 
## Description
Python is of the powerful language which also well-known for its automation things and stuffs. Developer have been using Python for creating various type of application in many different usecases. 
But in this topic will cover specifically on automation with python script to accomplish the tasks that would not require people to directly interact with, but can be done via Python programming and public API provider.
I've been exploring and using Pythonista to write and execute Python script to help me with some daily tasks and my side hustle business. One example of my usecase is for creating the subscription user account because creating user require administator to login into dashboard, fill-out the user info, add user into the correct cohort, then send the account credential to the user via facebook page manager, and then send the payment link. To complete this operation before it would take me approximately 10 minutes, also most importantly i also need to focus on my work tasks too, but i can automate all of these step with the Python script and cloud function, all i need to do is just click on the shortcut icon on iphone/ipad or calling the Siri. 
This is just one of the example and of course I want to use this to motiavte people to start exploring and implementing this to help them with their tasks.

## Why did I choose this topic?
Because automation is really an interesting topic and now with the capability to do it from their Iphone/Ipad, this will be so much helpful and fun at the same time. Which I think this will help to boost and motivate the young leaner to explore more on Python by starting right from their Iphone/Ipad.
Also the utimate goal is that I and the team, we'd like to start a Python community in Cambodia and host PyCon Cambodia next year or next next year!

## What the audience will learn and know-how from this topic
- Know how to write and run Python program in their Iphone/Ipad.
- Accessing useful data with Pythonista IOS-specific modules.
- Run their program with Iphone/Ipad app icon, extension, Siri.
- Having fun with automation from their mobile phone.
- They will come up with some great idea to automate their workflows.

## Prior knowledge the audience should have
- Basic Python syntax

## Audience experiment
Beginner student is good to go, it's all about interesting and fun.
